# SoS2-Hologram-Darklight-Glow
Are your pawns a) following an ideology with the Lighting precept, b) holographic, and c) crying about their own emitted light? With this hacky patch applied, Save our Ship 2 holograms now emit dark light instead of regular light. I'm not smart enough to make it a toggle, them's the breaks.

Installation:

Extract the SoS2-Hologram-Darklight-Glow-main folder to ~/Steam/steamapps/common/Rimworld/mods/
